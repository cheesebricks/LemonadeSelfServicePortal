# Content Type Analysis: Content Drift & Relevance Issues

## Overview
This analysis examines each content type for potential issues similar to the "GOD hired as Co-CEO" problem where the system generated completely irrelevant content.

## 1. MICROCOPY

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Intent-specific requirements**: Each intent has specific preferred verbs
- **UI context awareness**: Different requirements for button, error, tooltip
- **Strong validation**: Must include intent-specific verbs or gets -6 penalty

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues**
- **Intent drift**: If LLM ignores the specific intent, could generate generic content
- **Context confusion**: Button text might become too verbose despite 5-word limit
- **Semantic matching**: "pay now" vs "pay" - could miss intent variations

### üîç **Risk Assessment: LOW**
- Strong intent enforcement through lexicon scoring
- Clear word limits and penalties
- Specific UI context requirements

---

## 2. INTERNAL COMMS

### ‚úÖ **Strengths**
- **Keyword enforcement**: Requires ‚â•2 keywords from title+key_update
- **Channel-specific formatting**: Clear Slack vs Email distinction
- **Semantic matching**: Enhanced keyword recognition (dogs ‚Üí dog-free)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Issues**
- **Title inclusion**: Previously had unwanted title headers in Slack (FIXED)
- **Generic messaging**: Could drift into company boilerplate instead of specific updates
- **Keyword dilution**: Might include keywords but lose context

### üîç **Risk Assessment: MEDIUM**
- Good keyword enforcement but could still generate generic content
- Channel formatting issues (now fixed)
- Potential for corporate speak instead of specific announcements

---

## 3. PRESS RELEASE

### üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED**

#### **Content Drift Problem**
- **Weak prompt requirements**: Only required 1 keyword (now fixed to 2-3)
- **Generic feedback**: Retry system said "use professional tone" instead of "include specific announcement details"
- **No content relevance enforcement**: Could generate any insurance-related content

#### **Specific Example: "GOD hired as Co-CEO"**
- **Requested**: God, Co-CEO, haven/hell, life insurance, damnation
- **Generated**: Generic AI platform partnership content
- **Root Cause**: System lost focus on specific announcement

#### **Audience-Specific Issues**
- **Press audience**: Might generate generic corporate speak
- **Customer audience**: Could drift into marketing fluff
- **Investor audience**: Might lose specific financial details

### üîç **Risk Assessment: HIGH** (Now being addressed)

## 4. SYSTEMIC ISSUES ACROSS ALL TYPES

### üö® **Common Problems**

#### **1. Generic Feedback in Retry System**
- **Problem**: Feedback like "use professional tone" doesn't address content relevance

- **Solution**: Content-specific feedback with keyword requirements

#### **2. Weak Content Relevance Enforcement**
- **Problem**: TRS scoring focuses on style over substance
- **Impact**: High-scoring but irrelevant content
- **Solution**: Enhanced critic scoring with strict relevance requirements

#### **3. Corpus Reference Mismatch**
- **Problem**: References might not match the specific request
- **Impact**: LLM learns wrong style/content patterns
- **Solution**: Better reference selection and validation

#### **4. Prompt Template Weakness**
- **Problem**: Vague requirements like "include keywords"
- **Impact**: LLM interprets requirements loosely
- **Solution**: Specific, actionable requirements with examples

#### **Press Release**
1. **Specific announcement**: "GOD hired as Co-CEO" (should include God, Co-CEO, haven/hell)

3. **Product launch**: "New pet insurance for dragons" (should include dragons, pet insurance)

#### **Internal Comms**
1. **Specific policy**: "No dogs in office" (should include dogs, office, policy)
2. **Event announcement**: "Team lunch Friday 12pm" (should include team, lunch, Friday, 12pm)
3. **System update**: "Maintenance window 2-4am" (should include maintenance, 2-4am)

#### **Microcopy**
1. **Specific intent**: "pay now" (should generate payment-related content)
2. **Error context**: "file upload failed" (should address upload, failure, solution)
3. **Tooltip purpose**: "why we need this info" (should explain the specific need)
